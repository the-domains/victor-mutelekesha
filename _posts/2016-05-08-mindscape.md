Mindscape.

These are a series of relief landscape pieces titled 'mindscape'. These pieces investigate the possibility of random and fast regeneration of the land‚Äê scape using synthetic material I have just discovered using "Acrylic1". This idea stems from our endemic consumerist culture and the project suggests creating landscapes for short-term use and dispose off later like any other consumer product.
