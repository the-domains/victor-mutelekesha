Rise to the ashes. 2009

"Halo"

This projects explores a very unusual configuration between the signifier of spiritual holiness (the halo) and the stem cells, an attempt

which could be as bizarre as it might get in this desire to heal part of the human condition influenced by "Identity."

Here identical forms derived from stem cells that are about to grow into neurons hangs in space forming a circular resemblance of the

halo (the halo Jean-Michel Basquiat might have painted above most of his characters identifying the spiritual connection of sort in them)

and as you enter the space the installation above you senses your presence in between then and instantly glow to life. You become the

conduit that completes a circuit of life. For a moment the feud between science and spirituality loses traction because the very basic

building block of the human body (stem cells) at a stage when they are so pure and clean without any blemish of physical "identity"

takes the symbolism of spiritual purity when the broken halo is brought back to life.

The feud between creationist and evolutionist has protracted for too long degen‐ eration the human condition in the process. But the

urgency of now is over‐ whelming to put things right so I do not seek a compromise of any sort but I intend to image a solution 'the third

perspective if you so wished".

The third perspective being sort is that of neutral human identity if such can ever be archived. Note one very important feature in the

video provided; the light emitted from the crystal glass is blue; one colure that form a single sky for all humanity. As it lights up every time

any individual passes it confirms your humanness regardless of your Physical, Racial, creed, religion, sex or other wise
