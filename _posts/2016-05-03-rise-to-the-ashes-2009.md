Rise to the ashes. 2009

"Rise to the ashes"

This sculpture installation depicts a model of the world map topography but if you look carefully you realize the adulations are not in

correspondence with the real geography of the world map, as we know it. What you see is a reflection two different statistical data that

show a distribution and concentration of higher GDPs and processed global wealth and places where you find the some of the biggest

open pit mines in the world representing places of extraction and subsequent deployment of those commodities.
